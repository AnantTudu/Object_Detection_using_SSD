# Object_Detection_using_SSD

Object detection is a crucial computer vision task that involves identifying and localizing objects within images or videos. Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD) is a popular deep learning algorithm known for its speed and accuracy in detecting multiple objects in real-time.

Unlike traditional object detection methods, SSD predicts object classes and bounding boxes simultaneously, making it efficient for real-time applications. The model processes an image or video frame in a single forward pass, resulting in fast inference times.

Key features of this system include:
1. Real-Time Detection: Capable of detecting objects in video streams with minimal latency.
2. Multi-Object Detection: Identifies multiple objects within a single frame and labels them with bounding boxes and class names.
3. Versatility: Supports various applications such as surveillance, autonomous vehicles, and retail analytics.
4. Pre-Trained Models: Utilizes pre-trained SSD models such as SSD-MobileNet or SSD-ResNet for higher accuracy and faster deployment.

The system provides a robust and scalable solution for scenarios requiring real-time object detection and can be integrated into larger AI-based systems for enhanced functionality.
